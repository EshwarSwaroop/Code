ACADEMIC PROJECTS: 

 

Title		            : Text Classification Using Machine Learning. 

Software used	: Jupyter Notebook, python 2.7, NLTK, Scikit-Learn. 

Project Description   : The project is executed using natural language processing, basically the           project classifies text messages as either spam or not spam, Machine learning algorithms are applied to achieve this using Jupyter notebook, python 2.7, Natural Language Toolkit, Scikit-learn 

 
Title		            : Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning and Neural Networks. 

Software used	: Jupyter Notebook, python 3.6, Scikit-Learn. 

Project Description   : A novel rainfall prediction method has been proposed. A two-step method has been employed. Greedy forward selection algorithm is used to reduce the feature set and to find the most promising features for rainfall prediction.  First, in the training phase the data is trained by system, Neural Network (NN) is applied. The proposed two step prediction model one is using machine learning approach and another one is Neural network approach has been applied. The data for experimental purpose is collected online over the period from 1901 to 2015. The experimental results have suggested a reasonable improvement over traditional methods in predicting rainfall.
